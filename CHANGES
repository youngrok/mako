0.1.1
- AST parsing fixes: fixed TryExcept identifier parsing
- added "encoding()" filter; this allows a filter expression to specify the encoding and error
handling for the given expression.
usage is like:  ${data | encoding('utf-8', errors='strict')}
- removed textmate tmbundle from contrib and into separate SVN location; windows users
cant handle those files, setuptools not very good at "pruning" certain directories
